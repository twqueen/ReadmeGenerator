# README Generator
    
## Description
This project is to help those of us who do not have the time to write out our own markdown file from scratch. It is very simple to use: just answer a few questions and a markdown will be generated. Only thing is there will be no formatting. Everything will be a generic paragraph. But upside is you won't need to worry about missing a section

## Installation
Please do a npm installation prior to running the script.
`npm i inquirer@8.2.4`
and
`npm i fs`
Recent version of inquirer will not work with this tool.
